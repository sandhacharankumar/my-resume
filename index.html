        <p><li>This Project describes the wavelet decomposition by histogram shifting and shaping method has better  contrast and Resolution of enhanced image. The final visual shows the good visual quality without any inconvinent washout effect and blurred of images.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <ul><h4>PAPR Reduction in OFDM</h4>
        <p><li>This Project describes the computational complexity is reduced based on the cost function by summing the samples of the time of the symbols 's' in V disjoint sib blocks. As the alpha decreases, the PAPR decreases. The reduced complexity PTS with companding OFDM system further increases the efficiency of high power amplifiers by reducing the PAPR to lower values.</li></p>
    </ul>
    <ul><h4>AMD IT Solutions</h4>
        <p><li>In this project I have  worked for 11 months, where I was used to to solve client issues regarding the issues they faced. Mostly I used Cmd prompt Terminal Technology to solve.</li></p>
